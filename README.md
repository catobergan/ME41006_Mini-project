# ME41006_Mini-project
This reposetory shows the code used in the mini-project of ME41006; though, the tuning (hsv, y-value, proportional gain, etc.) are completely wrong and the correct values only exist inside the actual robot.

Shooting_main.py is the main code used for the project. hsv_tuner.py was used to tune the hsv values. motor_onoff.py was given to us by the TA's and is used to test whether the firing mechanism works or not.
